      <div class="faq-list">
        <details class="glass">
          <summary>What's the difference between the Founder and Pro plans?</summary>
          <p>Both plans get the full app &mdash; bank sync, reports, budgets, goals, and Oracle. The difference is how Oracle's AI is powered. Founder ($49 one-time) uses your own API key from OpenAI or Anthropic &mdash; you control the costs directly. Pro ($20/mo) includes AI with no setup &mdash; we handle it, and Oracle just works out of the box.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="glass">
          <summary>Is this macOS only?</summary>
          <p>Yes. OpenFi is a native macOS app built with SwiftUI. This is a deliberate choice &mdash; local-first architecture means your data stays on your machine, and native means it's fast and integrates with macOS Keychain for credential security. Requires macOS Ventura or later. iOS is on the roadmap.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="glass">
          <summary>Do you ever see my bank credentials?</summary>
          <p>No. Bank authentication is handled entirely by Plaid &mdash; you authenticate directly with your bank through Plaid's secure flow. OpenFi never sees your bank password. Your credentials are stored in macOS Keychain, not in our app or on any server.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="glass">
          <summary>How is my data protected?</summary>
          <p>Your financial data is stored in an encrypted local database on your Mac. API keys and credentials are managed through macOS Keychain (hardware-backed encryption). We never see, store, or transmit your financial data. There's no cloud to breach. No analytics. No telemetry.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="glass">
          <summary>Can I track both spending and investments?</summary>
          <p>Yes. OpenFi connects to checking, savings, credit cards, loans, and investment accounts. You get a unified net worth view alongside spending analysis, goal tracking, and Oracle Q&A across everything.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="glass">
          <summary>What can I ask Oracle?</summary>
          <p>Anything about your finances. &ldquo;Why did my spending go up?&rdquo; &ldquo;Am I on track for my goals?&rdquo; &ldquo;What subscriptions can I cut?&rdquo; &ldquo;Can I afford this purchase?&rdquo; Oracle analyzes your real transaction data and gives you plain-English answers with evidence.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="glass">
          <summary>Can I import data from Mint, Monarch, or YNAB?</summary>
          <p>Yes &mdash; OpenFi supports CSV import for transaction history. Export from your current tool and import into OpenFi. Once your bank accounts are linked via Plaid, new transactions sync automatically.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="glass">
          <summary>What if you stop working on this?</summary>
          <p>Your data is a local file you own. Even if OpenFi disappeared tomorrow, your financial data is yours &mdash; it's just a file on your Mac. You can back it up, move it, or access it however you want. No vendor lock-in.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="glass">
          <summary>Does it work offline?</summary>
          <p>Yes. All your data, reports, budgets, and goals work offline. The only features that require internet are bank sync (via Plaid) and Oracle AI queries. Everything else runs entirely on your Mac.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="glass">
          <summary>What if I switch computers?</summary>
          <p>Copy your database file to your new Mac. Since everything is local, you own the file and can back it up however you prefer &mdash; Time Machine, iCloud Drive, or manual copy.</p>
